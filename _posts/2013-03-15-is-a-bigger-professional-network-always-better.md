<p>Usually, when a concept presents itself to me 2, 3, or 10 times in a short period of time I take it as a Vegas-esque sign pointing to itself and saying look at me! Relationship building and networking has been a semi-regular topic in the FTEMS program, but I've always thought of it as building new relationships and creating new connections to get ahead. I'm now beginning to realize that while creating new beneficial relationships is very important, it's equally important to focus on strengthening the relationships you already have.</p>
<h2>My Las Leadership neon sign</h2>
<p>A couple of weeks ago I did some serious leadership soul searching for an assignment titled our 'Leadership Development Plan'. Due to some low scores on the caring section of my Leadership360 review I decided to actively try to deepen two relationships this year. Then, just a few weeks later this same topic came up in my monthly mentor meeting and he gave the same advice. In short, the stepping stones to leadership are the nodes in your network between where you are now and where you want to be.</p>
<p>Sometimes, after two full days of lecture during class weekends the content just runs together like a melted box of crayons. I'm sure this idea has been presented by multiple people but it never clicked. Everyone always seems to focus on building a larger network. Even a valiant extravert like myself finds this tedious from time to time.</p>
<h2>A bigger network isn't always best</h2>
<p>No one's coming out and saying, "build a coaching and mentoring relationship with someone you already know that represents the next step in where you want to be". This could be your boss, a lateral but higher up project manager or team lead, or someone at a different company, the important thing is, it's someone you already have an established relationship with.</p>
<p>There are so many benefits to an established relationship. Less awkward, background knowledge, and awareness of motivation and goals just to name a few. I find myself asking, who represents the next couple of rungs in my leadership ladder? How receptive would they be to helping me? How can I provide value to them at the same time?</p>
<h2>The hidden growth in strong relationships</h2>
<p>One last thing to keep in mind. Deepening this type of relationship actually does grow your network by giving you greater access to that person's network. I don't know about you but I'm almost always more willing to pass on a contact or favor to someone I know and trust than to a stranger.</p>
<p>Have you successfully deepened a relationship with your boss or other hire up? How beneficial did you find that experience?</p>
