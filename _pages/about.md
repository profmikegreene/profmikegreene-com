<h1><span class="welcome">Welcome </span><span class="header">to profmikegreene.com</span></h1>
<p>I am a 21<sup>st</sup> century leader for <em>your</em> 21<sup>st</sup> century problems.</p>
<p>Focusing on web &amp; presentation creation, technology implementation &amp; training, <span class="amp">&amp;</span> 21<sup>st</sup> century problem solving, I excel at meeting the diverse needs of today's dynamic institutions.</p>
<h2>Why me?</h2>
<p>You're looking for someone with a unique balance of technical <em>chops</em> and leadership <em>style</em>. Someone who can effectively communicate strategic direction and goals to propeller hats (of which I proudly am one) and technical capabilities and issues to the C-Suite (club I hope to join one day).  And most importantly, someone who can passionately manage multiple, huge projects and cares about doing things right.  You're looking for me.</p>
<h2>What have I been up to lately?</h2>
