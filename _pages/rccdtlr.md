<h1>Why me?</h1>
<p>You're looking for someone with a unique balance of technical <em>experience</em><em style="font-weight: inherit;">,</em> leadership <em style="font-weight: inherit;">style,</em> and enterprise <em>vision</em>.</p>
<p>You're looking for someone who <em>truly</em> understands what RCC students, faculty, &amp; staff need from technology and learning resources.</p>
<p>You're looking for someone who can <em>effectively</em> communicate strategic direction and goals to geeks (which I proudly am) in a way that motivates and drives results; while also articulating technical capabilities and issues to executive staff in a way that's understandable and adds value.</p>
<p>You're looking for someone who can <em>passionately</em> manage multiple, huge projects and is <em>devoted</em> to doing things right.</p>
<p>You're looking for me.</p>
<h2>I am...</h2>
<p>I am a versatile, innovative, and goal-oriented technology leader with 8+ years experience in planning, implementing, and managing IT projects and systems. I work collaboratively with faculty, staff, and administration to deliver IT solutions to meet business needs.</p>
<p>I am a forward-thinking, resourceful, and dedicated faculty member with 6+ years of higher education teaching experience focused on leading 21st century persons and higher education institutions.</p>
<h2>Leadership Questions and Answers</h2>
<p>Hello, RCC hiring committee member! In preparing for this role, I've prepared answers to questions you might be asking yourself.</p>
<h3>#1 Why should I hire you?</h3>
<p class="responsive-iframe wide"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/zKMIgiSoxeU?rel=0" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="color: #393939;">When I first started working at RCC, I was a part time network technician. I didn’t know anything about IT or higher education. But I learned the fundamentals of networking, IT support, and PC troubleshooting. When I became an adjunct, I didn’t know anything about teaching, but I learned about pedagogy, educational technology, and student engagement. When I became Web Solutions Specialist, I did know about developing websites, but I had no clue what Microsoft SharePoint was, or how to program in PHP, or manage iPads, but I learned how.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>You should hire me because I’m more prepared for this role than any of the others I’ve previously taken on.</li>
<li>You should hire me because you already know the quality of work I bring to this organization.</li>
<li>You should hire me because you already know I collaborate effectively with the administration, staff, and students at the college.</li>
<li>You should hire me because I have the perfect set of technology, faculty, leadership, and cultural experience to be a great Dean of Technology and Learning Resources at RCC.</li>
</ol>
<h3>#2 Do you possess a master's degree in a related field from a regionally accredited college or university?</h3>
<p class="responsive-iframe wide"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/xjXfiOAWBjI?rel=0" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Yes, I have a Master of Science in Information Systems - IT Management and Leadership from Virginia Commonwealth University. If I had to summarize the degree in one sentence, it would be an MS in how to be a great CIO. Coursework focused on</p>
<ul class="courses-listing" style="color: #333333;">
<li style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;">Organizational Culture and Team Building</li>
<li style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;">Information Systems (IS) Management</li>
<li style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;">IS Planning and Project Management</li>
<li style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;">Analysis and Decisions</li>
<li style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;">IS Assurance and Security Management</li>
<li style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;">Structuring Information for Decision Making</li>
<li style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;">Emerging Technologies</li>
<li style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;">IS in the Digital Economy</li>
<li style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;">Enterprise Information Systems</li>
</ul>
<p>Outside of the coursework, the program focused on mentoring, networking and relationship building, and leadership; ultimately giving me a practical and balanced understanding of leading a 21st century IT environment. While the technical skills may vary, the same strategies apply directly to leading and managing a learning resources department as well.</p>
<h3>#3 Briefly describe your interpersonal and communication skills.</h3>
<p class="responsive-iframe wide"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/bX-ZF_dvRpo?rel=0" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>My six years of teaching experience has cultivated a versatile and dynamic interpersonal communication skill set. I am adept at communicating technical concepts to both technical and non-technical audiences across all functional units and college stakeholders.</p>
<p>I pride myself on my public speaking abilities. Outside of the classroom, I have presented at conferences across the state to both technical and non-technical audiences and excel at delivering impactful, magnetic, and innovative presentations that add value no matter what role an audience member might have in their organization.</p>
<p>I have also built a robust professional network within the college and across the VCCS which I consider one of the biggest assets I bring to this position. I know that if we have a problem that we can’t solve on our own, I can reach out to a world class faculty, staff, dean, or vice chancellor that will understand the environmental factors and challenges specific to our organization and offer insight that helps us deliver a solution that works.</p>
<h3>#4 Please briefly describe your experience managing employees including directing daily activities and staffing, facilitating department goals and objectives, motivating, training, and evaluating performance.</h3>
<p class="responsive-iframe wide"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/z7PUiEpJKaw?rel=0" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>As discipline lead for IT faculty at the college, I have led the college’s transition from ITE 115 Computer Applications to ITE 119 Information Literacy as the required IT course for all students pursuing a transfer degree. I have managed the implementation for the 5 IT faculty and 25 sections taught this academic year, and created shared objectives that serve as the basis for the course which has impacted over 300 students.</p>
<p>I also perform classroom observations on IT adjunct faculty which plays a crucial role in their performance evaluations.</p>
<p>In the classroom, I motivate, train and evaluate a diverse population of students in one on one, small group, and large groups of 50+.</p>
<p>I supervised  student work study who thought he may be interested in web design. Even though he was only in my ITD 110 course at the time, I used a challenge project to motivate him to complete work above his current level of study.  He was a full time student who also worked two other jobs. We created a staffing schedule around his prior commitments that allowed him to maximize his hours as work study, complete complex projects for me, and most importantly - keep his studies as his first priority. He researched a specific problem and created a system which I have implemented on several projects over the past 6 months and was able to graduate this may.</p>
<p>As chair for the VCCS New Horizons Technology Enhancement Committee, I led a cross functional team of VCCS volunteers responsible for analyzing which current technology trends intersect conference needs and managed the deployment of systems that enabled the fulfillment of those needs.</p>
<p>I am a member of several VCCS technology project steering, RCC governance, and RCC administrative committees. These committees are responsible for shaping the goals, objectives, and assessments for projects, departments, and organizations in the VCCS.</p>
<p>As a faculty and staff member, I have collaborated with every RCC department, employee level including executive staff, and the majority of our student population groups.</p>
<h3>#5 How would you describe your leadership style? How would you describe you management style?</h3>
<p class="responsive-iframe wide"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/BLt9yaHxNvY?rel=0" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Leadership is about relationships. I lead collaboratively, leveraging the experts around me to provide honest opinion and hard data and collaboratively reach consensus.</p>
<p>Management is about tasks, projects, systems, and tools. My management style is to look for ways to maximize efficiency for the college, my staff, and myself. The means delegating effectively and allowing staff to do work in the way to works for them, and willingness to change your daily routine if a new tool does it better.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #393939;">#6 What tools, techniques</span><span style="color: #555555;">,</span> <span style="color: #393939;">and strategies do you use to help in the decision-making process? </span></h3>
<p class="responsive-iframe wide"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/tftYBUPRyoc?rel=0" width="480" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="color: #393939;">It depends on the situation, but the primary tools I use would be data and relationships. Good data should prove a point on it’s own, but when that’s not good enough, you need to have delivered enough results in the past and built enough trust with others that they’ll trust your gut. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #393939;">Frequent and understandable communication is required from technology and learning resources to ensure that stakeholders receive the value we’re trying to deliver. Funding and delivering the perfect solution for someone means nothing if they don’t see the value in it and don’t use it and good communication plays a major role in making that happen. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #393939;">The best strategy is transparency. Especially in today’s world, there’s no point trying to sweep bad news under the rug. Get it out in the open, take responsibility, and move forward. The other benefit of true leadership transparency is people know you don’t have a hidden agenda. This builds trust because people know what they're dealing with and efficiency when you don’t have to waste time dancing around what's unsaid. </span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #323333;">#7 Please explain your understanding of the</span> RCC <span style="color: #323333;">mission and organization/governance structure, and how TLR can help to support and fulfill that mission? </span></h3>
<p class="responsive-iframe wide"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/SeXwUDO4Jlk?rel=0" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="color: #323333;">The RCC mission focuses on providing quality education experiences that prepare an individual to solve the problems of the 21st century. Lifelong learning is a requirement for everyone to keep up with the pace of today, the learning and technology resources we provide to students and community members are invaluable and continuing to expand the reach of online resources beyond the campus walls should be a primary focus of this department. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #323333;">Since RCC is publicly funded and part of the larger VCCS system, it’s governance system is complex but also robust. Strategy and funding are determined at the state level by the Chancellor and General Assembly and then focused by the President and executive staff. The PPEC and department managers create a plan to implement strategy and the FAAC and department managers create a budget that implements the strategy. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #323333;">Academic governance is performed by several committees focused on providing the highest quality of learning to students while meeting SACS-COC accreditation standards across the college.</span><br /><span style="color: #323333;">One way to think about technology and learning resources is it's our job to enable the facilitation and implementation of governance and it’s strategies. We enable these things to happen more smoothly and effectively.</span></p>
<h3>#8 What are your biggest strengths in relation to this position?</h3>
<p class="responsive-iframe wide"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/ajtLyQYmAcc?rel=0" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>One thing I realize moving into this position, is that simply relying on the same strengths that make me a great technologist or faculty will not guarantee success. This position requires a different set of skills in order to do the job well.</p>
<p>I bring to this position and the college a powerful professional network of relationships I've built up across the college and VCCS over the past 7 years. The average CIO tenure is under 5 years, it would take an outsider the majority of their tenure to develop these connections, slowing their ability to provide value back to the college.</p>
<p>A large percentage of this position's work is communication. I am experienced at communicating over traditional media, social media, and speaking publicly to audiences from few to several hundred members.</p>
<p>My diverse background as IT project manager, faculty experience, and leadership training helps create a mature professional who understands our college, our students, and how technology and learning resources can help the college achieve it’s goals.</p>
<h3>#9 What are your biggest weaknesses in relation to this position?</h3>
<p>I’m a perfectionist, especially in work that I'm held accountable for. My design background instilled in me the importance of little things. It’s the subtle unconscious things you don’t even realize are there that distinguish good design from great.</p>
<p>Understanding this is a tremendous asset when designing the student’s experience with the college, but it can also slow progress if I try to manage things too closely.</p>
<h3>#10 What opportunities do you see for this position and for IT and LR at the college?</h3>
<p>One of the biggest opportunities for this position is to strengthen relationships outside of academics at the executive staff level. I believe we have not fully maximized the value technology and learning resources can add across the entire organization and you have to start this shift at the strategic level.</p>
<p><span style="color: #393939;">I’m excited to hear we’re moving to cloud email. Moving commodity services to the cloud is a no brainer if the contracts are set appropriately and the college understands the risk/reward tradeoffs. I think investigating storage and infrastructure cloud solutions are a tremendous opportunity to reduce our data center footprint while providing better than our already amazing service to students and employees at equal or lower cost.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #393939;">I know this might not be popular, but I think there is an opportunity for some increased governance of technology and learning resources, particularly in the project management area. We’re too small to allow medium to large initiatives to fail and the risk that comes with even a single employee turnover is tremendous. Applying some process and structure will allow us to mitigate risk, provide more value to the organization, and I believe can be implemented in a way that allows technology and learning resources staff to shift focus away from firefighting today’s problems towards creating tomorrow’s solutions.</span></p>
<p>I know that this position does not currently manage the testing centers, but several staff to work with the proctor agreements for offsite testing. Could we implement standing proctor agreements with all dual enrollment, Vccs schools, and local Public libraries in a way that provide a better more seamless experience to students while improving the efficiency of the internal processes?</p>
<h3>#11 What threats do you see for this position and for  IT and LR at the college?</h3>
<p><span style="color: #393939;">The biggest threat is not putting students first. Losing sight of that focus leads to bad decision making, poor employee morale, and a less attractive student experience. All of which lead to less students. It’s important to start with why we are doing something and ensure that lines up with a student-first strategic goal.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #393939;">Diminishing budgets and low enrollment are more of a reality than threat, but are critical environmental factors for the college. There’s a big opportunity to leverage shared services provided by the VCCS to help shift budget responsibility and still provide quality services and resources.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #393939;">Higher ed is pretty bad regarding student experience on the whole. People want the Amazon 1-click experience, not the take an hour to fill out our application, wait for acceptance, horrible interface to register experience. These aren’t problems that can fixed without some true out of the box thinking. I think the VCCS as a leader in higher ed, and RCC as a leader in the system has an opportunity to influence some drastic change over the next few years.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #323333;">#12 What do you consider your most difficult challenge in the last five years? Please describe it and tell</span> <span style="color: #323333;">us</span> <span style="color: #323333;">how you addressed the problems. What was the outcome? How might you handle this differently today? What are the lessons learned? </span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #323333;">One of my most difficult challenges was launch day of the new college website. This wasn’t merely a cosmetic upgrade, there was a new server, new management system, new everything. Every web page had to be copied over to the new system manually. We went through a content audit to determine what pages needed to be created and I pulled together a cross functional team to get the job done. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #323333;">I communicated to the team the need to check all hyperlinks because many would be broken due to the new site’s navigation being different. We launched on a Tuesday night and sure enough, several important pages had broken links. The next day I received a highly energetic call from a senior administrator resulting in an afternoon of frantic fixes and major changes to several high impact pages to bring them in line with their vision.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #323333;">Afterwards, I’m happy to say the college walked away with an award winning website that has served our diverse student population for the past 3 and a half years.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #323333;">If I were to tackle this challenge today, I would have done many things the same. But I would add an additional audit with sign off for the content team to perform once the new site had been setup to ensure broken links were fixed and an executive sponsor sign off before going live to alleviate potential surprises for all stakeholders.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #323333;">The biggest takeaways from this challenge were one, I saw IT project management practices as an opportunity to be better at my work, two, it gave me a deep understanding of how to pull together and work with cross functional teams, and three, it illustrated the need for the work that I did to be collaborative with college administration and moving forward I worked much more closely with the administration.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #323333;">#13 What innovative trends to you see happening in higher ed IT and LR? Give</span> <span style="color: #323333;">us</span> <span style="color: #323333;">some examples of technology trends you see happening in our society today that can or will have</span> <span style="color: #323333;">an</span> <span style="color: #323333;">impact on the</span> <span style="color: #323333;">college? </span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #323333;">One of these things we can do that will be the most impactful the fastest is to communicate the value we already are providing. Technology and learning resources at RCC has been extremely innovative over the past five years and unfortunately people often become too busy to take it advantage of the tools and services were already providing.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #323333;">Implement a communication plan that allows people to reacquaint themselves with the portfolio of innovation services we offer and have the opportunity to provide feedback where they see gaps.</span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #323333;">Open Educational Resources</span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #323333;">A highly impactful trend is open educational resources (OER) and creative commons licensing. This is really a change in the mindset of academia and licensing more than technology, but it has the power to change everything.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #323333;">Knowledge has an inherent desire to be known by as many people as possible - OER just makes sense for 21st century education.</span></p>
<h4>The Effective use of Mobile</h4>
<p>The computing landscape has changed. I have students writing research papers on their smart phone, the majority of employees walk around with their work email and access to college data in their pocket. We need to embrace these platforms where appropriate and asking a lot of questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>How do we support this longterm?</li>
<li>How do we train our staff?</li>
<li>How can we leverage these platforms?</li>
<li>How can we provide a reasonably secure environment while providing a quality user experience?</li>
</ul>
<h4><span style="color: #323333;">Cloud/Shared Services</span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #323333;">The idea of paying someone who is an expert at building and supporting the one thing I am paying them to build and support as opposed to expecting one of my staff to provide the same level of expertise across a plethora of services makes a lot of sense to me.</span></p>
<p>We can leverage these types of services to provide better experiences to students and employees, free IT staff to focus on higher level issues and solutions, and provide more value to the college for the same and often less cost.</p>
<p>This position will need to develop a strategy around deciding which implementation fits the college needs the best. Do we...</p>
<ol>
<li>Host in-house as an RCC private cloud</li>
<li>Partner with the VCCS as a shared public/private cloud</li>
<li>Partner with a vendor to host services in a public cloud</li>
</ol>
<p>More and more of the services technology and learning resources provides to users will be web accessible from wherever you are. Providing these services securely and with the best possible user experience should be a goal of the department.</p>
<h3>#14 How would you go about ensuring excellence and currency in technology?</h3>
<p><span style="color: #353535;">Trying to keep up with the pace of technology is something I have baked into my daily routine for years. I use RSS to scan around 1000 headlines a day and mark the interesting ones to be read and shared later. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #353535;">There’s a saying that good programmers know what to code and great programmers know what to steal. Don’t reinvent the wheel and expect yourself to have to come up with the best ideas all the time. Leverage the resources at your disposal.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #353535;">Talk to people, talk to CIOs, to staff, talk to students - they’ll tell you when something isn’t meeting their level of excellence. This is another opportunity for some formalized IT governance. A regularly meeting committee of faculty, technology and learning resource staff, and students could ensure excellence and currency better than one person.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #353535;">Ultimately, we must focus on providing the best educational experience for our students.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #353535;">#15 How would you work with administration to establish priorities and budget for IT and LR acquisitions?<i> </i>Describe creative funding models or strategies to susta</span><span style="color: #525252;">i</span><span style="color: #353535;">n existing techn</span><span style="color: #525252;">i</span><span style="color: #353535;">cal</span> <span style="color: #525252;">i</span><span style="color: #353535;">nfrastructures, yet provide funds to build innovative new ones?</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #353535;">Start with our strategic plan. This shared document helps prevent politics and daily urgent problems or ‘fires’ as they are sometimes called in IT from steering us away from where we need to be headed. Which projects and action items get us there the fastest, cheapest, and easiest? Those are no brainers. Some questions to help prioritize may be,</span></p>
<ul>
<li>What enhances the student’s educational experience the most?</li>
<li>What provides the most value to the college?</li>
<li>Can we reevaluate standing contracts? Do we have contracts ending that can be renegotiated with the same or new partners?</li>
<li>Can we leverage cloud and shared services to provide equal or better value?</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #353535;">As far as 'innovative' funding, rolling training time and dollars into projects is a real win-win. It helps motivate staff to explore and expand their horizons and allows them to do their job better. Being able to align these projects with their personal objectives is key to motivating employees and maximizing the value of the dollars we spend.</span></p>
<h3>#16 Where do u see yourself in 5 years?</h3>
<p><span style="color: #393939;">I see myself as a valuable and successful leader at the college by consistently providing a better educational experience to our students than we do today. </span><span style="color: #393939;">Having furthered RCC’s reputation for innovative and quality technology and learning resources throughout the community, VCCS, higher education sector. I will have finished my d</span><span style="color: #393939;">octorate in leadership and be </span><span style="color: #393939;">looking for a new challenge to advance my career further.</span></p>
<h3>#17 If you were leading a major project and the project was tanking what would you do?</h3>
<p class="responsive-iframe wide"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/GIO-SzIClZs?rel=0" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Take a breath and Be thankful you were able to find out now and not tomorrow or six months from now. Get the data, figure out the root cause, and create a plan to move forward - this may mean canceling the project.</p>
<h3>#18 How would you describe this job?</h3>
<p class="responsive-iframe wide"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/qgLlzT_P0qk?rel=0" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>This job is about uncovering the real needs of students, faculty, and staff, communicating how technology and learning resources can meet those needs, and partnering with other departments to meet those needs effectively and efficiently.</p>
<p>It’s about collaborating with college stakeholders to create a vision for technology and learning resources that creates a quality learning environment for students and a motivating work environment for technology and learning resources staff.</p>
<p>And it’s representing the whole of technology and learning resources at the administrative and system office level in a way that balances the technology and learning resources staff’s needs with the strategy and direction of the college and VCCS.</p>
<h3>#19 If selected for the position, how would you go about determining what issues and tasks to first address? How would you go about implementing a planned course of action?</h3>
<p><span style="color: #323333;">1. I would survey my staff, meet with the VP and P, and survey students and employees to discover problem areas.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #323333;">2. Look for easy wins and implement quickly to build relationships and earn trust with staff and administration.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #323333;">3. Meet with technology and learning resources staff, students, and administration to prioritize problem areas and create a plan to implement appropriately.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #323333;">4. To implement, I’d hold project kickoff meetings to set the objectives and deliverables in writing. Have an executive sponsor sign of on the deliverables, timeline, and budget and begin work.</span></p>
<h3>#20 How would you motivate a staff in our environment?</h3>
<p><span style="color: #393939;">I believe that life is too short not to love going to work. As a manager, one of my responsibilities is to try and create an environment that each of my staff loves working in.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #393939;">Without the normal motivator of bonus pay, I would rely more on removing de-motivators and cultivating an individual’s internal motivators whenever possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #393939;">How could we automate a particular process that you find dreadful? What areas are you interested in receiving training in? Can I align some projects to that area to help provide training dollars and experience for you?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #393939;">Understanding what makes someone tick on the inside is key to real motivation.</span></p>
